## Orbiter 2.0 Stealthburner mount with CW2 shroud

**This mod works on Trident 300 and 350 builds ONLY**. 250 build simply has no space needed to accomodate the holder and the spool.
Sliding 8mm linear guides allows for adjustable spool width. Supported spool size is 200mm in diameter and up to max 75mm wide, typical for spools up to 1kg - 1.2kg.

## Why?

Well, why not!? üëç

## Print Setup

All parts are printed without supports. Recommended material is PCCF, why? Well, if you are printing high temp materials in a heated enclosure, parts should not soften or loosen in any way, PCCF is very stiff, lightweight and will withstand very high temperatures without losing any of its amazing properties. Will it be ok to print it in ABS/ASA, absolutely! but the parts may not last as long as PCCF. Recommended perimeter count is 4 and 5 top/bottom layers with infil from 30%+. All parts in STL already have correct orientation, just import and print.
